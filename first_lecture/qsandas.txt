	-freeze
		Freezes the item at the specified value until it is forced again or until it is unforced with
		a noforce command (CR-204). Optional.
	-drive
		Attaches a driver to the item and drives the specified value until the item is forced again
		or until it is unforced with a noforce command (CR-204). Optional.
		This option is illegal for unresolved signals.
	-deposit
		Sets the item to the specified value. The value remains until there is a subsequent driver
		transaction, or until the item is forced again, or until it is unforced with a noforce
		command (CR-204). Optional.
		If one of the -freeze, -drive, or -deposit options is not used, then -freeze is the default
		for unresolved items and -drive is the default for resolved items.
		If you prefer -freeze as the default for resolved and unresolved VHDL signals, change
		the default force kind in the DefaultForceKind (UM-623) preference variable.
	-cancel <time>
		Cancels the force command at the specified <time>. The time is relative to the current
		time unless an absolute time is specified by preceding the value with the character @.
		Cancellation occurs at the last simulation delta cycle of a time unit. A value of zero
		cancels the force at the end of the current time period. Optional.
	-repeat <time>
		Repeats the force command, where <time> is the time at which to start repeating the
		cycle. The time is relative to the current time. A repeating force command will force avalue before other non-repeating force commands that occur in the same time step.
		Optional
